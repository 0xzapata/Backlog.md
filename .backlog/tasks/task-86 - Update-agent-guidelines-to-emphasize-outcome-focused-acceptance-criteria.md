## Description

The current agent instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursorrules) need clearer guidance on writing proper acceptance criteria. AI agents should be instructed to write acceptance criteria that focus on outcomes, behaviors, and requirements rather than implementation steps. This will help distinguish between acceptance criteria (what must be achieved) and implementation plans (how to achieve it).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLAUDE.md contains clear guidelines on writing outcome-focused acceptance criteria
- [ ] AGENTS.md includes examples of good vs bad acceptance criteria
- [ ] .cursorrules has updated instructions for AI agents about acceptance criteria
- [ ] Guidelines clearly distinguish between acceptance criteria and implementation plans
- [ ] Examples show acceptance criteria using measurable outcomes and behaviors
- [ ] Instructions emphasize that acceptance criteria should be testable/verifiable
- [ ] Guidelines discourage step-by-step implementation tasks in acceptance criteria
- [ ] Documentation includes best practices for when to add implementation plan sections

## Implementation Plan

1. **Review Current Guidelines**
   - Audit existing agent instruction files for acceptance criteria guidance
   - Identify gaps or unclear instructions about acceptance criteria

2. **Define Standards**
   - Create clear definition of acceptance criteria vs implementation plans
   - Develop examples of good and bad acceptance criteria
   - Define when implementation plans should be added

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Add acceptance criteria guidelines to CLAUDE.md
   - Update AGENTS.md with examples and best practices
   - Enhance .cursorrules with specific instructions for AI agents
   - Include templates or examples for reference

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Review updated guidelines for clarity and completeness
   - Ensure consistency across all agent instruction files
