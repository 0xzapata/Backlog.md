## Description

The README currently has one large CLI reference table with too many rows. Need to: 1) Add documentation for the 'backlog agents --update-instructions' command that allows updating agent instruction files (.cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, etc.) 2) Split the CLI reference into multiple organized tables by purpose (Task Management, Board Operations, Configuration, Web Interface, etc.) for better readability and discoverability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document agents upgrade command with examples
- [ ] Split CLI reference into purpose-based tables
- [ ] Maintain all existing command documentation
- [ ] Improve overall README readability
