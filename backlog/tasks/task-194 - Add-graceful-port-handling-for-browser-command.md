## Description

When launching 'backlog browser' command, if the default port is already in use, the application crashes with a cryptic error message instead of gracefully handling the situation by either finding an available port or providing a clear error message with suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Browser command detects when port is already in use
- [ ] Clear error message is displayed when port is unavailable
- [ ] Command suggests alternative solutions (different port or stop conflicting process)
- [ ] Application exits gracefully without cryptic stack traces
- [ ] User can specify alternative port via command line flag
