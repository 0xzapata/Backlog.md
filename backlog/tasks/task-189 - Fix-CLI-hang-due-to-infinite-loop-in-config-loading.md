## Description

The Backlog.md CLI becomes unresponsive when the backlogDirectory field is missing from config.yml. This critical issue occurs due to an infinite recursion in the configuration loading process, causing the CLI to repeatedly call configuration methods without resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI does not hang when backlogDirectory is missing from config.yml
- [ ] Configuration loading correctly handles missing backlogDirectory field
- [ ] Default backlog directory is set when field is missing
- [ ] No circular dependencies in configuration loading process
- [ ] Tests cover the scenario of missing backlogDirectory
