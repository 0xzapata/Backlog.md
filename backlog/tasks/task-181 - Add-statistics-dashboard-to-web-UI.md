## Description

Create a Statistics/Dashboard page in the web UI that displays project overview, task statistics, priority breakdowns, and activity metrics in a visual dashboard format with charts and interactive elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add Statistics/Dashboard page route to web UI
- [ ] Create /api/statistics endpoint for project metrics
- [ ] Display status distribution with visual charts
- [ ] Show priority breakdown with color-coded sections
- [ ] Include completion percentage and progress indicators
- [ ] Display recent activity timeline
- [ ] Add interactive charts and data visualizations
- [ ] Show project health metrics and trends
- [ ] Include export functionality for statistics
- [ ] Add navigation link in side menu
- [ ] Use responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Handle loading states and empty project gracefully

## Implementation Plan

1. Add Statistics route and navigation link
2. Create /api/statistics endpoint:
   - Status counts and percentages
   - Priority distribution
   - Recent activity data
   - Project health metrics
3. Design dashboard layout with cards/sections
4. Implement data visualizations:
   - Status pie/donut chart
   - Priority bar chart
   - Activity timeline
   - Progress indicators
5. Add interactive features:
   - Drill-down into specific metrics
   - Date range filtering
   - Export to CSV/JSON
6. Create responsive dashboard components
7. Add loading states and error handling
8. Style with consistent design system
9. Test dashboard with various data scenarios

## Implementation Notes

DASHBOARD SECTIONS:

Project Overview Card:
- Total tasks
- Completion percentage
- Active tasks (In Progress)
- Project health score

Status Distribution:
- Visual pie/donut chart
- Clickable segments for filtering
- Percentage breakdowns
- Status trend over time

Priority Analysis:
- Horizontal bar chart
- Color-coded by priority level
- Percentage and count display
- Priority trend analysis

Recent Activity:
- Timeline view of recent changes
- Task creation/completion events
- Most active contributors
- Activity heatmap

Performance Metrics:
- Average completion time
- Task velocity (completed per week)
- Bottleneck identification
- Burndown chart

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Reuse statistics calculation functions from task-180
- Use Chart.js or similar for visualizations
- Responsive grid layout
- Real-time updates with API polling
- Export functionality with browser downloads
- Caching for performance
- Progressive loading for large datasets

API STRUCTURE:
GET /api/statistics:
{
  overview: { total, completed, inProgress, percentage },
  statusBreakdown: [{ status, count, percentage }],
  priorityBreakdown: [{ priority, count, percentage }],
  recentActivity: [{ date, type, description }],
  trends: { completion, velocity, health }
}
